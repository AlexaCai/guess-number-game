## Project description

This game web app was created to allow users to stimulate their brain by playing a simple yet enjoyable game in which they need to find a number. They can then share their highest score with friends if desired.

## User interface

The interface changes dynamically through DOM manipulation and user interactions with UI elements. 

To guess the secret number, users can enter the desired number in the empty box provided for this purpose and then click on the "Check!" button. They can repeat this process until they discover the secret number or until their score reaches 0 (game over). The highest score achieved in a session is automatically saved as the user's best score, and this score is updated automatically when necessary (when the user establishes a new highest score surpassing the previous one).

Users can click the "Again" button at any time to reset the interface while retaining their highest score, allowing them to attempt to surpass it in the next round.
  
## Technical aspects

The game is built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS and is [hosted on GitHub gh-pages](https://alexacai.github.io/guess-number-game/).
